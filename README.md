## 🎥 Video Integration

All tasks are now linked to a centralized video course platform. The base URL for all videos is configured in `src/AuthApp.jsx`:

### Current Video Platform

```javascript
const BASE_URL = 'https://developcoaching.memberships.msgsndr.com/products/b472d77a-977d-493d-9a8a-005794ad92c7';
```

### Changing the Video Base URL

To update the video platform URL:

1. Open `src/AuthApp.jsx`
2. Locate the `BASE_URL` constant (around line 40)
3. Update it to your new platform URL:

```javascript
const BASE_URL = 'https://your-new-video-platform.com/course-id';
```

All task links will automatically use this base URL.

### Task Structure with Revenue Tiers

Tasks are organized by revenue milestones with visual separators:

```javascript
const ROADMAP_CONTENT = {
  Plan: {
    '£500K': [
      { text: '1 Year Forecast', link: `${BASE_URL}` },
      { text: 'Asana Task Management', link: `${BASE_URL}` },
    ],
    '£1M': [
      { text: 'Software Tracking', link: `${BASE_URL}` },
      // ... more tasks
    ],
    // ... more revenue levels
  },
  // ... more columns
};
```

Each task link opens the video course in a new tab when clicked.

**⭐ Key Files for Customization**:
- `src/AuthApp.jsx` - Main roadmap component with authentication, task data, and logic
- `src/AuthApp.css` - Main roadmap styles with revenue section styling
- `src/Roadmap.jsx` - Alternative standalone roadmap component (localStorage-based)
- `src/Roadmap.css` - Alternative roadmap styles

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Changing Brand Colors

Edit `src/AuthApp.css` - The color palette is defined at the top:

```css
/* Color Palette:
 * #fdce36 (Primary Yellow/Gold)
 * #fbaa35 (Secondary Orange/Yellow)
 * #414042 (Dark Grey - Text & Headers)
 * #d2d2d2 (Light Grey - Borders & Backgrounds)
 * #f7f7f7 (Background Grey)
 */
```

Use Find & Replace to update colors throughout the file.

### Adding New Tasks

1. Open `src/AuthApp.jsx`
2. Find the appropriate column and revenue level in `ROADMAP_CONTENT`
3. Add your task object:
   ```javascript
   { text: 'Your New Task', link: `${BASE_URL}` }
   ```

### Adding New Columns

1. Add a new key to `ROADMAP_CONTENT` with the column name
2. Define tasks for each revenue level (£500K, £1M, £2M, £3M, £5M)
3. The application will automatically render the new column

### Changing Revenue Levels

1. Modify the `revenueRows` array in `src/AuthApp.jsx`:
   ```javascript
   const revenueRows = ['£500K', '£1M', '£2M', '£3M', '£5M'];
   ```
2. Update all revenue levels in `ROADMAP_CONTENT` to match

### Customizing Revenue Dividers

The yellow dividers between revenue sections can be styled in `src/AuthApp.css`:

```css
.revenue-divider-aligned {
    border: none;
    border-top: 2px solid #fdce36; /* Change color/thickness here */
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0;
}
```

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **React 19.0** - UI framework
- **Vite 6.3** - Build tool and dev server
- **CSS3** - Styling with custom properties
- **LocalStorage API** - Progress persistence
- **Firebase** - Authentication (via AuthApp component)

---

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

- **Desktop**: > 1024px (Full layout with side scale)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (Adjusted layout, side scale visible)
- **Mobile**: < 768px (Vertical stack, side scale hidden)

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

The application uses **Firebase Firestore** for cloud-based data persistence:

### User Authentication
- Email/Password authentication
- Google Sign-In integration
- Password reset functionality
- Profile data collection (name, company, phone)

### Progress Storage
- **Storage Location**: Firebase Firestore database
- **Path**: `artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/roadmap_progress/checks`
- **Data Format**: JSON object with task names as keys and boolean values
- **Sync**: Progress automatically syncs across all devices where user is logged in

### Profile Data
- **Storage Location**: `artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/profile_data/info`
- **Data**: Name, email, company name, phone number, registration date

### Alternative: Local Storage Version
The `Roadmap.jsx` component provides a simpler, localStorage-based version without authentication for standalone use.

---

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### Reset All Progress
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.removeItem('roadmapChecks');
location.reload();
```

### Export Current Progress
```javascript
// In browser console:
console.log(localStorage.getItem('roadmapChecks'));
```
