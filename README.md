## 🎥 Adding Video Links

To add video tutorial links to tasks, you need to edit the `taskMap` object in `src/Roadmap.jsx`:

### Step 1: Locate the Task Map

Open `src/Roadmap.jsx` and find the `taskMap` object (starts around line 8).

### Step 2: Add Your Video URLs

Each task object has a `videoUrl` property. Simply add your video URL:

```javascript
const taskMap = {
  Plan: {
    '£500K': [
      { task: '1 Year Forecast', videoUrl: 'https://youtu.be/your-video-id' },
      { task: 'Asana Task Management', videoUrl: 'https://vimeo.com/your-video' },
      // ... more tasks
    ],
    // ... more revenue levels
  },
  // ... more columns
};
```

### Step 3: Video URL Format

You can use any video platform:
- **YouTube**: `https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID` or `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
- **Vimeo**: `https://vimeo.com/VIDEO_ID`
- **Custom hosting**: Any direct video URL
- **Leave empty**: Tasks without a URL (`videoUrl: ''`) will display as plain text

### Example

```javascript
Attract: {
  '£500K': [
    { 
      task: 'USP', 
      videoUrl: 'https://youtu.be/abc123xyz' 
    },
    { 
      task: 'Brand Guidelines', 
      videoUrl: '' // No video yet
    },
  ],
}
```

When a task has a video URL, the title becomes a clickable link that opens the video in a new tab.

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Changing Brand Colors

Edit `src/Roadmap.css` - The color palette is defined at the top:

```css
/* Color Palette:
 * #fdce36 (Primary Yellow/Gold)
 * #fbaa35 (Secondary Orange/Yellow)
 * #414042 (Dark Grey - Text & Headers)
 * #d2d2d2 (Light Grey - Borders & Backgrounds)
 * #f7f7f7 (Background Grey)
 */
```

Use Find & Replace to update colors throughout the file.

### Adding New Tasks

1. Open `src/Roadmap.jsx`
2. Find the appropriate column and revenue level in `taskMap`
3. Add your task object:
   ```javascript
   { task: 'Your New Task', videoUrl: 'optional-url' }
   ```

### Adding New Columns

1. Add a new key to `taskMap` with the column name
2. Define tasks for each revenue level
3. The application will automatically render the new column

### Changing Revenue Levels

1. Modify the `revenueRows` array in `src/Roadmap.jsx`:
   ```javascript
   const revenueRows = ['£500K', '£1M', '£2M', '£3M', '£5M'];
   ```
2. Update all revenue levels in `taskMap` to match

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

- **Desktop**: > 1024px (Full layout with side scale)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (Adjusted layout, side scale visible)
- **Mobile**: < 768px (Vertical stack, side scale hidden)

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

### Production Mode (AuthRoadmap.jsx)
The application saves your progress to **Firebase Firestore**:
- **Database**: Cloud Firestore
- **Storage Path**: `artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/roadmap_progress/checks`
- **Data Format**: JSON object with task names as keys and boolean values
- **Auto-Sync**: Progress automatically syncs across all your devices
- **User-Specific**: Each user's progress is stored separately and securely

### Demo Mode (Roadmap.jsx)
Uses **browser's localStorage** for offline persistence:
- **Storage Key**: `roadmapChecks`
- **Data Format**: JSON object with task names as keys and boolean values
- **Device-Specific**: Progress saved locally on current browser only
- **Clearing Progress**: Clear browser data or localStorage to reset

---

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### Reset All Progress
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.removeItem('roadmapChecks');
location.reload();
```

### Export Current Progress
```javascript
// In browser console:
console.log(localStorage.getItem('roadmapChecks'));
```
